# weather-dashboard

This project is a weather dashboard with live data and capacity to search cities for current weather and five-day forecast. 

My knowledge of the following is demonstrated: 

- jQuery 
- Ajax 
- Single page application building 
- HTML/CSS

## Clone the app 

Copy the url under the 'clone' button above. Open up your terminal, and run 

```git clone <url>```

## Starting the app locally

Clone into the root directory of the project, and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
